For the beginning stages of this project the Ogre tutorials were a huge help. They helped me set up the scene with ambient lighting and familiarize myself with adding SceneNodes. The tutorials also mentioned how to create and texture a plane. I used this process and decided to clone a generic Entity for each wall instead of defining a new plane and mesh for each one. After that, it just took getting used to the coordinate system and the concept of yaw, pitch, and roll to position each of them. I had a problem getting the camera to see a majority of the room so I positioned it further in the back of the room and played with its field of view. I used the code from the class slides to get an idea of how objects are moved within the scene and checking wall bounds. Once the basic functionality was done I added in the feature of updating the camera to look at the ball position.
