User Manual

The objective of the game is to hit the ball into the score zone, which is
denoted by a dark green box on a red wall. Each score is worth 1 point, and the goal is to score as many points as possible. The score zone will change to a random position on the red wall every time it is hit and the ball will get a velocity boost. If the player misses the ball and it goes past the paddle or the ball is allowed to come to a slow creep, they lose and must restart the game. To control the paddle use the following keys:

W ->            move up 
A ->            move left 
S ->            move down 
D -> 			move right 
Up Arrow ->     pitch paddle to face upwards    -> Alternative Key: J
Down Arrow ->   pitch paddle to face downwards  -> Alternative Key: H 
Right Arrow ->  roll paddle to the Right        -> Alternative Key: K 
Left Arrow ->   roll maddle to the Left         -> Alternative Key: L

Use the SPACE bar to start the game and to hit the ball with the paddle.
Important note: You must hit the ball with the paddle or the ball will
eventually stop moving.

Use the R key to pause and restart the game.

There is also a menu the player can click on with the mouse to pause the game, turn on/off sounds, and quit the game.
