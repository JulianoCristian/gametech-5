Ac!d Milestone 3.3

Status Update

Completed:
-GUI changes for multiplayer menu options. Also changed scoreboard to adapt to multiplayer mode.
-Set up the multiplayer scene with two paddles. Removed the score wall and goals since it is irrelevant for multiplayer mode.
-Linked networking library and tested out the server-client connection.
Changed paddle movement control to the mouse instead of WASD keyboard events.
-Finished implementing game states such as pausing, resuming, restarting, and end-game. This is necessary for synchronization with multiplayer mode.
-Added paddle whiffing sound which was missing in the previous version of the game.

In progress:
-Establishing the protocol for transferring object positions and hit boxes for synchronized physics simulation.
-Updating the clientâ€™s frame rendering queue using positions and orientations received from the server.
